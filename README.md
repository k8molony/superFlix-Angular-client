# SuperFlixAngularClient

## Intro

The client-side for an application called superFlix based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database), with supporting documentation.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

## Key Features

- The app should display a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an account.
- Once authenticated, the user should now view all movies.

  - A button that when clicked takes a user to the director view, where details about the director of that particular movie will be displayed.
  - A button that when clicked takes a user to the series view, where details about that
    particular series of the movie will be displayed.
